This is a game with 4 types of characters that fight. They start off with base stats. There is a chance of their attacks having a more special outcome than simply attacking directly. 

There are two lines at the end with one commented out: 

One runs through a single elimination tournament move by move and has a winner at the end of it.
The other runs through that same tournament 1000 x 3 times and shows which type of character wins what percent of the 1000 tournaments for each of the three groups of runthroughs. The purpose of this is to show the balance of the characters' fighting abilities.
